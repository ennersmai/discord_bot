# Product Requirements Document: Discord Link Timeout & NLP Bot

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Status:** Draft
**Authors:** AI Assistant

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Discord bot designed to moderate link sharing, provide natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, and offer multi-language support. The bot will automatically timeout users who attempt to share links within designated channels and provide enhanced features through integration with the Google Gemini 2.5 NLP model. This PRD serves as a guide for development, testing, and deployment.

## 2. Goals

*   **Reduce Spam & Unsolicited Links:** Minimize the prevalence of irrelevant or harmful links within the Discord server to improve channel quality.
*   **Automate Moderation:** Reduce manual moderation workload by automating link sharing policy enforcement.
*   **Enhance User Engagement:** Provide helpful and engaging interactions through natural language processing.
*   **Multilingual Support:** Support both English and Bulgarian languages for commands and responses to cater to a diverse user base.
*   **Ease of Use & Configuration:**  Ensure easy configuration and usability for moderators and server members.

## 3. Target Audience

*   **Discord Server Moderators:**  Individuals responsible for maintaining server order and enforcing rules.
*   **Discord Server Members:**  General users of the Discord server who will interact with the bot or be affected by its moderation actions.

## 4. Features

### 4.1 Link Detection & Timeout

*   **Link Detection:**
    *   The bot monitors designated channels for URLs.
    *   URLs must be identified regardless of variations (e.g., `example.com`, `www.example.com`, `https://example.com`).
*   **Timeout Mechanism:**
    *   Upon detection of a link, the bot automatically timeouts the user for a configurable duration.
    *   A message explaining the timeout reason should be sent to the user.
*   **Exemptions:**
    *   Moderators can exempt specific users or roles from link timeouts.
    *   Exemptions should persist across bot restarts.
*   **Configurable Channels:**
    *   Moderators can specify which channels are subject to link detection and timeout.
    *   Multiple channels can be configured.
*   **Activity Logging:**
    *   Log all link timeouts, including user ID, channel ID, timestamp, and the URL that triggered the timeout.
*   **Timeout Duration:**
    *   The timeout duration should be configurable via a command (in seconds).

### 4.2 Natural Language Processing (NLP)

*   **Gemini 2.5 Integration:**
    *   Leverage the Google Gemini 2.5 API for advanced NLP features.
    *   Securely manage API keys.
*   **Custom Commands:**
    *   Allow users to interact using natural language (e.g., "Summarize the last 5 messages in #general", "What is the current news about AI?").
    *   Commands should handle variations in phrasing and grammar.
*   **Question Answering:**
    *   Answer user questions based on information available through the NLP model.
    *   Handle ambiguous or complex questions gracefully.
*   **(Optional) Sentiment Analysis:**
    *   Analyze message sentiment to identify potential issues (e.g., negativity, aggression).
    *   Trigger automated responses or alerts based on sentiment.
*   **(Optional) Text Summarization:**
    *   Summarize lengthy conversations or documents.
    *   Provide adjustable summary lengths.

### 4.3 Multi-Language Support

*   **Default Language Setting:**
    *   Moderators can set a default language (English or Bulgarian) for bot responses.
*   **Language-Specific Commands:**
    *   Support commands in both English and Bulgarian (e.g., `/timeout` and `/таймаут`).
    *   Provide localized help messages for each language.
*   **(Optional) Dynamic Language Switching:**
    *   Allow users to specify their language preference for individual commands or for all interactions.

### 4.4 Command Interface

*   **Discord Slash Commands:**
    *   Implement commands using Discord's Slash Command functionality for ease of discovery and use.
    *   Provide clear command descriptions and parameter hints.
*   **Help Command:**
    *   Provide a `/help` command listing all available commands and their usage.
    *   The help message should be localized based on the user's or the server's configured language.
*   **Moderator Commands:**
    *   `/set_channel <channel>`:  Sets the link monitoring channel.
    *   `/set_timeout_duration <seconds>`: Sets the timeout duration (in seconds).
    *   `/exempt_user <user>`: Exempts a user from link timeouts.
    *   `/exempt_role <role>`: Exempts a role from link timeouts.
    *   `/set_language <language>`: Sets the default language (en/bg).
*   **User Commands:**
    *   `/help`: Displays available commands and their usage.
    *   `/ask <question>`:  Queries the NLP model with a question.

### 4.5 Configuration & Management

*   **Web Dashboard (Optional):**
    *   Vue.js-based dashboard for easier configuration and management.
    *   Secure authentication for moderators.
*   **Discord Command Configuration:**
    *   Alternatively, configuration can be primarily managed through Discord commands for simplicity.
    *   Provide clear and concise instructions for using configuration commands.

### 4.6 Error Handling

*   **Informative Error Messages:**
    *   Provide clear error messages to users and moderators, indicating the cause of the error and potential solutions.
    *   Error messages should be localized.
*   **Detailed Logging:**
    *   Log errors, exceptions, and other relevant events for debugging and troubleshooting.
    *   Include timestamps, user IDs, and channel IDs in log messages.
